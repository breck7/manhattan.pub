title WorldWideTypes

* This folder contains the start of a project to build a grammar of world wide types. The idea is to have a grammar containing the most common types used in the world, that anyone can use and contribute back to.

* Currently it supports type declarations and interfaces.

* It will compile to TypeScript at first, and other languages later.
